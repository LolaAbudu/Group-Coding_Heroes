# Coding_Heroes
Group project that allows users to explore the Github portfolios of each member of a group. 
It contains a Navigation Button in the toolbar/actionbar that, when clicked, displays a navigation 
drawer that allows the user to choose the biography page of each team member. There is a navigation 
back arrow on the toolbar/actionbar allowing the user to jump back to the main activity at anytime. 
Within each biography page contains a popup menu in the toolbar/actionbar for 3 (three) Github projects 
created by that team member that, when clicked, redirects to an external web browser app displaying 
that particular Github link to the screen.
